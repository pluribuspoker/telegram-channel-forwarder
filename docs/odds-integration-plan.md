# Odds Integration — Plan & Current State

## Goal

Add odds to pick result broadcasts. Primary use-case: show the odds on each pick in the
broadcast result message (e.g. `✅ Capper · Duke -4.5 (-153)`).
Secondary: capture odds at message-send time in the listener (future).

## What Has Been Built

### `scripts/audit_odds.py`

Backtest/verification script. Reads `data/result.json` + `data/result_df.json`,
parses picks via Claude, fetches closing odds from Odds API, outputs `data/odds_audit.csv`.

**Key design:**
- Two-step Odds API fetch (unlocks alternate lines on existing paid plan):
  1. `GET /historical/sports/{sport}/events?date=…` — cheap event list, 1 quota
  2. `GET /historical/sports/{sport}/events/{id}/odds?markets=…` — full odds per event, ~10 quota
- Markets fetched per event: `h2h, spreads, totals, alternate_spreads, alternate_totals,
  h2h_h1, spreads_h1, totals_h1, h2h_h2, spreads_h2, totals_h2, h2h_q1, spreads_q1, totals_q1`
- ESPN fallback (`espn_bookmakers_for_teams` in `scores.py`) for pre-game picks where
  Odds API has no event; ESPN clears odds after game completion so this only fires live.
- Proximity matching up to 1.5 pts with half-point juice adjustment
  (`HALF_POINT_COST` per sport, ~0.022 implied-prob per half-pt)
- All Odds API responses cached to `data/odds_api_cache.json`
- Parse results cached to `data/audit_parse_cache.json`

**Current backtest results (109 picks):**
- 63 odds found (57%): 32 exact main line, 28 exact alt line, 3 proximity
- 20 unsupported sports (UFL/Tennis/Boxing — different data sources needed)
- 12 player props (separate endpoint needed)
- 9 no-game: small NCAAB schools + minor UFC cards not priced by Odds API
- 3 team totals (not in standard markets)
- 1 alt-line gap >1.5pts remaining

### `scores.py` additions

- `extract_espn_bookmaker(competition)` — converts ESPN `competition.odds[0]` to
  Odds-API-style bookmaker dict (h2h/spreads/totals, main lines only, no alternates)
- `espn_bookmakers_for_teams(espn_data, teams)` — finds event in ESPN scoreboard,
  returns bookmaker list (empty for completed games)
- `_QUALIFIERS` now includes `"st"` to prevent "Tennessee" matching "Tennessee St Tigers"

## Odds API Details

- **Key:** in `.env` as `ODDS_API_KEY`
- **Plan:** ~100k monthly quota (paid plan). Used ~49k so far this month.
- **Cost per backtest run:** ~300-500 quota (cached after first run — subsequent runs free)
- **Quota display:** `x-requests-remaining` header returned on every call
- **Sport keys:**

| Our name | Odds API key |
|---|---|
| NBA | `basketball_nba` |
| NCAAB | `basketball_ncaab` |
| NFL | `americanfootball_nfl` |
| NCAAF | `americanfootball_ncaaf` |
| MLB | `baseball_mlb` |
| NHL | `icehockey_nhl` |
| UFC | `mma_mixed_martial_arts` |

## What Has Been Built (continued)

### `odds.py`

Production module. Key exports:
- `fetch_odds(sport, game_date, pick) -> OddsResult` — ESPN first, historical Odds API
  fallback. SQLite cache in `picks.db` (tables: `odds_cache`, `events_cache`).
- `OddsResult` — carries `match_type`, `odds`, `bookmaker`, `api_line`, `pick_line`.
  `.validate_for_display()` runs sanity checks before Telegram output.
  `.is_unexpected_miss` / `.is_structural_miss` for failure triage.
  `.format()` → `"-110"` / `"+150"`.
- `quota_used()` — Odds API units consumed this process.

`audit_odds.py` imports all matching logic from `odds.py` (no duplication).

## Next Steps (in order)

### 1. ~~Cost tracking~~ ✅ Done

### 2. ~~Build `odds.py` module~~ ✅ Done

### 3. ~~Wire odds into tracker~~ ✅ Done

Fetches at first encounter via `fetch_odds_current()` (live endpoint). Stored in
`parse_cache.json` (`odds_by_pick` per pick index) and `picks.db` (`grades.odds`).
Never re-fetched. Immediately edited into destination message while PENDING; preserved
through grading edit: `Hawks +3.5 (-115)✅`.

Failures (all types) → one audit channel warning per pick, never repeated.
Soft sanity warnings (extreme odds, proximity gap) → audit channel + log.
Summary line: `odds:X/Y`.

### 4. ~~Show odds in broadcast~~ ✅ Done

Odds shown inline in broadcast message and edited into pick message text.
Format: `✅ Duke -4.5 (-153) · Capper`. Graceful degradation if NULL.

---

## Known Gaps / Next Iteration

- **Match rate**: ~91% on recent picks. Iterate on misses and sanity warnings as they
  surface in the audit channel.
- **Team totals**: not in standard Odds API markets — always `NULL`.
- **MLB First 5 Innings ML**: `h2h_1st5` not returned by Odds API — always `NULL`.
- **Live bet odds**: picks labelled "live bet" have no pre-game line — always `NULL`.
- **Tennis, Boxing**: no Odds API coverage — need separate data sources.
- **Proximity sanity warnings**: review cases where adjacent-line adjustment fires.
